                <h2 id="life-in-sapporo">Life in Sapporo</h2>
<p>I have been living in Sapporo, the capital city of Hokkaido, for many years now.  Hokkaido is very famous for its virgin forests, beautiful nature, dairy products, and fresh seafood. Sapporo is surrounded by many mountains, which I love the most. And the sea is just 15 km from the city. What else do I need!? The mountains and sea make Sapporo city perfect for hiking and camping. My life in Sapporo was great with occasional hiking, camping and it became perfect after my wife and daughter came to live with me.</p>
<h2 id="typhoon-jebi">Typhoon Jebi</h2>
<p>
  <img src="/img/typhoon.jpg" alt="typhoon">

</p>
<p>Recently we have had sightseeing trips around the Sapporo and Otaru city along with my parents. As soon as they left, slowly we came out of the vacation zone and back on routine life. A few days later, on 4th September it was Anita’s (my wife) birthday. A typhoon Jebi almost ruined the birthday celebration that night. It was supposed to come over Sapporo around 9:30 PM. So, we had to finish everything up before that time. Though we finished everything an hour before, it was raining a bit. So, we stayed at our friend’s house for a night. The whole night typhoon Jebi was rattling the windows and pouring water.</p>
<h2 id="the-earthquake">The Earthquake</h2>
<p>Next day was very clear. A clear sunny day after the typhoon is the best day in the life! The previous night we could not sleep well so, on the night of 5th September, I was sure not to wake up until 7 in the morning. I went to sleep. I was in deep sleep probably dreaming something. Suddenly I felt a huge jerk. When I opened my eyes and came back to senses I realized I was not sleeping anymore nor Anita. I was in sitting posture and left hand was giving support to my body. We both were looking at each other in great confusion, probably wondering the same thing that, what the heck just happened now that wake both of us at the same time!? Did you feel the same big jerk like me? I was about to ask her what happened? But suddenly after the pause of 2 seconds or so, I started feeling like I was sitting in a car that was going in full speed over the unending speed breakers. That was the earthquake!  I jump over the Anita and grabbed my 2-year-old daughter (Anvi) and hide in the lower compartment of wardrobe that is built in the wall, to be safe from falling ceiling if it does. We have had experienced the smaller quakes of intensity 2-3 a few times. Apart from this, a few months ago, the North Korean leader went crazy about test firing missiles. He tests fired few missiles of which 2 missiles flew over Hokkaido into the Pacific Ocean. Which literally freaked us out that time. So, we prepared ourselves for such emergency situations and decided to keep the lower compartment of wardrobe empty, where 3 adults can easily fit in, and hide there in case of an earthquake or incoming missile threat. We kept that empty but hoped never to have to use it.  But, Murphy’s law, whatever can happen will happen, never fails.  As soon as I reached the lower compartment of wardrobe Anita somehow crawled below the table and keep repeating the name of God she believes in. I was trying to guess the intensity of quake while holding Anvi tightly without hurting her. The quake lasted for almost 40 seconds, reaching the maximum intensity of 6 in our area, and heartbeat to almost more than 120 bpm. At one moment I thought we are all going to die now. But, quake stopped. Anvi had already started crying, possibly because she thought I woke her up shaking, for no reason. We messaged our close friends and make sure they are okay. Later, Anita and I checked if there is anything fallen from a height and broken. Fortunately, there was nothing. I checked the time, it was 3:10 in the morning.  Immediately we got to dress up and went out to the safety of the street outside.  Obviously, it was dark and cold, we went outside but were clueless where to go, what to do. We stayed in an open space for a few minutes. Then, I went to the house and brought my camping lamps, blanket, jackets and water bottles, still were clueless about what to do and where to go. So far 15-20 minutes had passed since the big quake. I almost came back to normal state. Friends started calling me. Chetna was crying. She said we are fortunate that there is only one floor above our apartment. I pointed out what if the whole building collapse? You live on the 10th floor. Rahul and I started laughing, and Chetna started crying like a baby.  It wasn’t funny, but a joke was necessary to get ourselves back to the normal state as soon as possible. So that we can think well and prepare ourselves for worse situations. Around 30 minutes after the big quake the whole Hokkaido went in a blackout. In the meantime, Jagjit came on his bicycle laughing and explained how he heard a big sound from the ceiling and was ready to jump out of the window in case of house collapses. All these laughs and jokes were possible only because every house/building in Japan is built as resistant as possible for an earthquake. There were no casualties in Sapporo that I know of. But, many people died in Atsuma village, near the epicenter, due to landslides.</p>

<h2 id="recovery-after-quake">Recovery after quake</h2>
<p>We decided to go to the park near our house. While on our way, we were surprised to see the cars still running on the streets as if nothing happened. The only difference was the signals were not working. But that didn’t make any difference to traffic. Every car would stop on every signal (though it was not working), a driver would make sure there is no one walking or other car is not crossing if there is the driver would stop for the person or car and then would slowly go forward. We were stunned by the people’s gesture.  We found a good place to sit in the park spent almost 2 hours there and around 6:15 we returned. Until then there were no stronger aftershocks. As soon as we reached back home. There was a strong quake of intensity 5. Now, there was no way we will stay home. We packed the bags and went to the park again. Those who are living in buildings did not have electricity, gas, and water in their apartment. Fortunately, in our house gas and water did not stop. People lined up in all the stores to stock the food in case the aftershock causes more damage. Within a few hours stores were empty.  The whole day we avoided going inside the house. By the afternoon we decided to sleep in the park in a tent to avoid injury if the aftershock should cause more damage. In the evening one of our friends told us about the evacuation site. So, we decided to go there. Evacuation sites are built for such emergency situations. Those are steal buildings built to stand still even in case of a very strong earthquake. Many people had taken shelter there. We felt much safe there. We went there with the only expectation that no matter how strong earthquake hits, the building won’t collapse and nobody in the building will die. But, when we went there the situation was well above expectations.  There were people from the government looking after the those who are taking shelter in the evacuation site. They provided sleeping bags, food, drinks, first aid almost every basic need of the person, including WiFi. As electricity was back on Japanese people who had taken shelter returned home. So, a number of evacuees decreased the shelter was closed progressively to resume the school. I have never experienced the earthquake before in India. So, I had in mind that once you survive the big earthquake it’s all over, there is no need to worry about earthquake anymore.  But, the aftershocks haunts more than the primary earthquake, though they are of smaller intensity. The main reason for this was, the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) in 2011 was preceded by several large magnitude foreshocks. So, everyone was a skeptic if the earthquake that we experienced, was it foreshock before the larger earthquake or is it the major earthquake? So, whenever the earth starts shaking some of us literally scared to death, including Anita who cried almost after every aftershock.  Fortunately, that earthquake was not foreshock, it was the main earthquake. The foreshocks are the earthquakes of a comparatively smaller magnitude that occurs before the largest magnitude earthquake. GEJE had four major foreshocks on 9th March in excess of 6.0 magnitude, among which one was reported to have 7.2 magnitudes. The largest magnitude M9.1 was recorded on 11th March 2011, which triggered a powerful tsunami of up to 40.5 meters in Miyako city of Japan.  It’s been almost a month after the Hokkaido’s earthquake but still, Sapporo is getting aftershocks. Fortunately, the frequency has decreased significantly. But the earthquake of intensity 4 still strikes the Sapporo sometime. Now I have become so stubborn that even if the aftershock hits Sapporo I have learned not to react, keep calm and keep doing what I am doing.</p>
